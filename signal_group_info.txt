SIGNAL GROUP CONFIGURATION ISSUE FOUND:

Current Status:
- You have TWO groups named "Ohms Alerts Reports"

Group Details:
1. OLD GROUP (messages sent here but no one else to receive):
   - ID: group.ZmFLQ25IUTBKbWpuNFdpaDdXTjVoVXpYOFZtNGVZZ1lYRGdwMWpMcW0zMD0=
   - Members: ["+16572463906"] (only you)
   - Status: Active but empty

   - ID: group.cUY1YUE5SHRRMW0wQy9SVGMrSWNvVTQrakluaU00YXlBeVBscUdLUFdMTT0=
   - Members: 8 other members
   - Your Status: In "pending_requests" - need to accept invite
   - Invite Link: https://signal.group/#CjQKINt32QjJxlAbqjC22WE26xbRE9UMcUgCPttd15JxcxjPEhB2LIW5CW8UQpcceUiQ38cF

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Accept the pending group invite in Signal app for +16572463906
2. Configuration has been updated to use the correct group ID
